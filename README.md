## Introduction

A Contact Management System (CMS) is a software tool or application designed to help individuals and businesses efficiently organize and maintain their contact information. 
It allows users to store, update, search for, and retrieve details about their contacts, including names, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, and more. 
A CMS simplifies the process of managing a large number of contacts, making it easier to stay connected with clients, colleagues, friends, and family. 
It is particularly valuable for businesses and professionals who need to maintain a comprehensive database of their contacts for networking, communication, and customer relationship management.
